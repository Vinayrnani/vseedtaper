# Requirements Change Log

## v8 — 2026-09-16
- CCW drum + right hopper rebuild (overrides v7 direction/sides): drum anti-clockwise (top moves -X), crank/lower clockwise, upper idler CCW; hopper mirrored to +X right as open wedge (upper lip 1:30, lower lip 3 o'clock tilted up ~7°), mouth tangent gap 1.0; shroud mirrored to left (+60..+240°); bottom 6-o'clock drop; viewer rotation.z signs flipped; crank L-handle kept (r=45).

## v7 — 2026-09-16
- Hopper 10:30-11 rebuild (overrides v6): elongated open-top box trough top-left (-X, away from crank), no cone/chute/lid/joint; wide tangent mouth (~114-157°, gap 1.0) for direct cavity scooping; shroud same thin 180° shell minus tabs, clocked to -60..+120° (lip at 11 o'clock); no viewer transform changes.

## v6 — 2026-09-16
- Hopper/shroud sketch rebuild: open funnel + bottom taper chute (no lid/legs/wiper/drop-tube), 180-deg thin shroud (1.75 gap, no feet/bore), M3 flange joint at 3-o-clock; interfaces (part names, drum [100,60] R25 W15, tape path) unchanged.

## v5 — 2026-09-16
- Parts isolation panel: per-part checkbox + solo (chassis/hopper/shroud/cartridge/cones_a/cones_b/plow/rollers_lower/rollers_upper/crank + tape/seeds), All on/off, visibility-only toggles preserving crank radius 45 animation.

## v4 — 2026-09-16
- Fit-fix: all parts must land inside chassis interior in live preview (no dangling/empty chassis); transforms derived from animated_assembly() + GLB bounds; crank [0,45,0] orbit preserved.

## v3 — 2026-09-16
- Gear-mesh + crank-motion fix: applied Fix D, refined transforms, fixed static grip root cause, regenerated GLBs, verified grip radius 45.0 and all readouts.
