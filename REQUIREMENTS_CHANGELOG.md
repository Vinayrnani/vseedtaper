# Requirements Change Log

## v18 — 2026-09-16
- Regen speedups + OpenSCAD upgrade: persistent Xvfb, binstl+q, persistent Python converts, dirty-only temp files; try OBS openscad-nightly (manifold) with loud fallback to 2021.01

## v17 — 2026-09-16
- Hopper mouth fixes (RED/BLUE/PINK): RED diagonal side pads deleted (crossed cavity sweep); BLUE arc side-closure fins r26.5-28.5 30-122deg fuse cheek roots (x14-24) to cover lip, mouth sides closed/middle open gap 1.0; PINK tip sealed watertight (floor to x84, 6-thick nose x78-84 foot 60, void ends x70, 2-wide tip blocks) — single watertight hopper solid

## v16 — 2026-09-16
- Closed bowl tip + sides-only joint (gap back to 1.0), drop plow outlet chamfer (code state before v17; requirements entry recorded retroactively)

## v15 — 2026-09-16
- Actual changes.jpg markups (image read directly, overrides v14 guess, no yellow present): blue drum/bracket interface fit (mouth gap 1.0->0.7, tab/joints widened to seat flush), red support-tab pivot relief (tab slimmed + lifted z66->68), pink tip/wall (apex knife-edged, floor 2.5->3.5, plow outlet chamfer)

## v14 — 2026-09-16
- changes.jpg markup: red blocking rib removed (seed path clear), blue side joints retained (shroud↔hopper support), pink gaps sealed (closed walls), yellow channel grooves matching drum for wheel-to-frame positioning (not seed drive)

## v13 — 2026-09-16
- Refine hopper to closed container, shroud to open 11-6 half-pipe 16mm/8mm, drum 6 cavities, matching grooves, joints

## v12 — 2026-09-16
- Bottom-center drop / 11-to-6 cover rebuild (overrides v11 tube side + cover clocking + wedge tilt): wedge top edge exactly horizontal (73→73); retention cover re-clocked 45..240°→120..270° (top lip 11 o'clock, bottom lip 6 o'clock at tube); drop tube moved left x=67→bottom-center x=100 (bore 7, 5mm guided drop, tape 35→30 under drum, carve-sculpted funnel mouth, no ribs); drum CCW + left crank r=45 unchanged.

## v11 — 2026-09-16
- Right-pickup / left-drop / left-crank rebuild (overrides v10 tube/crank sides): drop tube mirrored from right corner to LEFT (~9 o'clock, bore centre world x=67, fed by cavities via drop window through cover arc); crank moved from roller axle (x=160) to drum-axle left end direct-drive (x=77.5, CCW locked to drum); wedge pickup mouth gap 1.0 unchanged; hopper still one wrap-around object; drum CCW unchanged (picks right, carries over top, drops left).

## v10 — 2026-09-16
- Single wrap-around hopper (overrides v9 hopper/shroud split): shroud arc merged into hopper_body() as left retention cover (45..240°, wall 2, gap 1.5, fused at 1:30 step tab); right wedge + corner drop tube unchanged; separate shroud part removed from viewer (module/branch kept as legacy stub); mirror-check proves viewer not mirrored (wedge toward +X crank side); drum CCW, crank right L-handle r=45 preserved.

## v9 — 2026-09-16
- hopper2.jpg rebuild (overrides v8 hopper/shroud/drop): sharp-point side-view wedge hopper on right (upper wall ~horizontal from 1:30 step, lower floor +8° about 3-o'clock point to apex x=83, open-top trough between triangular cheeks); corner drop tube at 3-o'clock L-step (bore 7x15.6, bottom world z=38, fused into hopper_body, GLB names unchanged); shroud left-only C 45..240° (top squared lip mates hopper step at 1:30); dropSeed animation moved to tube exit (133, 38→35). Assumptions: left dashed crank circle is schematic — crank stays right (roller gear drive preserved); drop fused into hopper GLB (separate drop GLB not added, part names kept).

## v8 — 2026-09-16
- CCW drum + right hopper rebuild (overrides v7 direction/sides): drum anti-clockwise (top moves -X), crank/lower clockwise, upper idler CCW; hopper mirrored to +X right as open wedge (upper lip 1:30, lower lip 3 o'clock tilted up ~7°), mouth tangent gap 1.0; shroud mirrored to left (+60..+240°); bottom 6-o'clock drop; viewer rotation.z signs flipped; crank L-handle kept (r=45).

## v7 — 2026-09-16
- Hopper 10:30-11 rebuild (overrides v6): elongated open-top box trough top-left (-X, away from crank), no cone/chute/lid/joint; wide tangent mouth (~114-157°, gap 1.0) for direct cavity scooping; shroud same thin 180° shell minus tabs, clocked to -60..+120° (lip at 11 o'clock); no viewer transform changes.

## v6 — 2026-09-16
- Hopper/shroud sketch rebuild: open funnel + bottom taper chute (no lid/legs/wiper/drop-tube), 180-deg thin shroud (1.75 gap, no feet/bore), M3 flange joint at 3-o-clock; interfaces (part names, drum [100,60] R25 W15, tape path) unchanged.

## v5 — 2026-09-16
- Parts isolation panel: per-part checkbox + solo (chassis/hopper/shroud/cartridge/cones_a/cones_b/plow/rollers_lower/rollers_upper/crank + tape/seeds), All on/off, visibility-only toggles preserving crank radius 45 animation.

## v4 — 2026-09-16
- Fit-fix: all parts must land inside chassis interior in live preview (no dangling/empty chassis); transforms derived from animated_assembly() + GLB bounds; crank [0,45,0] orbit preserved.

## v3 — 2026-09-16
- Gear-mesh + crank-motion fix: applied Fix D, refined transforms, fixed static grip root cause, regenerated GLBs, verified grip radius 45.0 and all readouts.
